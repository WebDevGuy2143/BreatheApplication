# BreatheApplication

Best viewed on anything bigger than a mobile device. 

I wrote this application from while watching Brad Traversy's tutorual. 

The point for this application is to help you calm your breathing when in an anxiety-like state.
You breath in when the text inside the circle says "Breathe In".
You hold you breath when the text inside the circle says, "Hold".
...and finally you breathe out when the text inside the circle says, "Breathe Out".

The colors really give a relaxing sense of mental environment I think, so I hope it does the same for you as well.
I think the animatded ball moving around the circle as you breathe, hold, and breathe out, really gives a sense of focus as well as a visual of breathing in and out.

Thanks and Enjoy!
